- **Backend**: Python Flask server
- **Frontend**: Modern HTML/CSS/JavaScript chatbot UI

## How It Works
1. User sends a query through the chat interface
2. The query is sent to the Flask backend
3. Backend searches for relevant context in Pinecone vector database
4. LLaMA generates a response using the query and retrieved context
5. Response is displayed in the chat interface

## Example Use Cases
- Answer questions about stored knowledge
- Provide information and explanations
- Assist with various tasks
